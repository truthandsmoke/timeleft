# Earth's Atmosphere CO2 Timeline Calculator

This script models and estimates how much time humans have left to breathe and reproduce naturally, based on atmospheric CO2 concentration projections.

## Overview

The calculator processes the following factors:

1. **Current CO2 levels** (420 ppm as of 2023)
2. **CO2 toxicity threshold** for human breathing (estimated at 4200 ppm, 10x current levels)
3. **CO2 emission trends** with a gradually decreasing growth rate to model renewable adoption
4. **Tree sequestration** (approximately 7.6 gigatons/year)
5. **Other natural carbon sinks** like oceans and soil (approximately 10.1 gigatons/year)

## Scientific Model Details

The model incorporates:

- A gradually decelerating emissions growth curve to simulate renewable energy adoption
- A slightly declining carbon sequestration capacity over time to account for climate effects on ecosystems
- Current annual emissions of approximately 36.8 gigatons CO2
- Total natural carbon sequestration of approximately 17.7 gigatons CO2 per year
- Net annual CO2 increase of approximately 19.1 gigatons/year

## Results

Based on these parameters, the model estimates that atmospheric CO2 will reach toxic breathing levels (4200 ppm) in approximately:

- 436 years (around the year 2461)

## Visualization

The script generates a plot showing the projected CO2 concentration over time, saved as `co2_trajectory.png`. The visualization includes:

- Current CO2 levels
- Toxic breathing threshold
- Projected year when CO2 reaches toxic levels

## Limitations and Disclaimers

This model is a simplified representation based on current trends and available data. The actual timeline could be significantly different due to:

1. Technological advancements in renewable energy and carbon capture
2. Policy changes and international climate agreements
3. Natural climate feedback loops (positive and negative)
4. Potential tipping points in the climate system
5. Uncertainties in the precise level at which CO2 becomes toxic for human breathing

## Usage

To run the script:

```
python3 timeleft.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3
- matplotlib
- numpy

## About the Data

- Current CO2 levels from global measurements (2023)
- Tree sequestration rates from global forest carbon sink studies
- Emissions data from global carbon budget assessments
- Ocean and soil carbon sink estimates from climate research

This is a simplified model for educational purposes. Real-world outcomes depend on countless variables and human actions.
